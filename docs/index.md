# Context

This documenetation will help you learn how certain frameworks work. You might of been redirected here because you have been appointed(or are working with a frontend scripter) with the goal of implementing skills directely into the game's framework.
## Payments
!!!note "Payment availability"
    Payments are available in robux, but not always in USD. If you prefer USD, you should ask if the option is available.
### Front-end payment
Front end developers will get paid 250K per skill. If you are working with someone, this can be split in whatever manner you prefer
!!!warning "advice against half assing"
    If some directions are ignored you won't be paid the full amount, instead some deductions will be taken. This will only happen if we warn you countless times and the changes aren't made.
### Skill-implementation payment
If you are also a front end developer, these payments will be given ontop of the payment stated in the previous block.
#### Rates
 - 28,571 Robux or $100 - Easy skill
 - 57,143 Robux or $200 - Medium Skill
 - 85,714 Robux or $300 - Hard Skill

The difficulty in which a skill is assumed may change before or after the implementation is done, And it may change depending on the amount of work you'd have to do. If you are provided with resources, this may change the assumed difficulty.
#### Code cleanelyness Bonus

 - 42,857 Robux or 150 - Super clean and good code

The individual that'll determine the level of cleanelyness for your code may be yourself(If you have shown to be knowledgeable) or someone within Ouw Productions who has been appointed to do so.
#### Gameplay consideration Bonus
 - 0 Robux or $0 - No consideration/left it up to someone else
 - 14,286 Robux or $50 - Minor changes need to be made to your code in order to adjust it for gameplay
 - 28,571 Robux or $100 - Skill is good gameplay wise
!!!question "'Why bother with implementing skills to the framework when i already made 250K robux per skill xD'"
    In order to make that 250K robux you would of had made somewhat of a backend for the skill, why not just use a specific framework and make some extra money? And it takes Ouw 30mins to 1 hour to implement a skill, imagine making up to 550 dollars for 30 minutes worth of work.
